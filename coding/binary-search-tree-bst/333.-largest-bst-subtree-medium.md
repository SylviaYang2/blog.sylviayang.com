# 333. Largest BST Subtree (Medium)

Given the root of a binary tree, find the largest subtree, which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST), where the largest means subtree has the <mark style="color:red;">**largest number of nodes**</mark>.

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties:

* The left subtree values are less than the value of their parent (root) node's value.
* The right subtree values are greater than the value of their parent (root) node's value.

**Note:** A subtree must include all of its descendants.&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one. The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [4,2,7,2,3,5,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
* `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`

&#x20;

**Follow up:** Can you figure out ways to solve it with `O(n)` time complexity?



### Approach: Post-Order Traversal

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (207).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By traversing each tree's children first, we can pass information about **subtrees up to the parent**.&#x20;

In the previous approaches (Pre-Order Traversal), we also used the `countNodes` function to traverse the same set of nodes on which `isValidBST` was called.\
We know that the size of a tree is equal to 1 plus the left subtree size plus the right subtree size.

So, instead of calling `countNodes` separately, we can pass the number of nodes in the current subtree up to the parent as well to get the size of the current tree in constant time.

Thus, the following information must be passed up the tree when finding the largest BST:

1. Whether each subtree itself **is BST**.
2. The **maximum** value in the subtree.
3. The **minimum** value in the subtree.
4. **Size** of the subtree.

**Algorithm**

1. Traverse each node of the given tree in a post-order manner.\
   That is, visit the left child, then the right child, and then the root node.
2. For each node, perform the following checks to determine if the subtree rooted at the current node is a BST:
   * Current node's value should be smaller than minimum node value of right subtree.
   * Current node's value should be greater than maximum node value of left subtree.
3. If the tree rooted at the current node is BST:
   * Calculate the size of the current subtree by adding 1 (for the current node) to the size of the left subtree plus the size of the right subtree.
4. Otherwise, if the current node is not a BST, return max BST size in left or right subtree of the current node.

```java
class Solution {
    public int largestBSTSubtree(TreeNode root) {
        return largestBSTSubtreeHelper(root).maxSize;
    }

    private Node largestBSTSubtreeHelper(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new Node(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE, 0);
        }

        Node left = largestBSTSubtreeHelper(root.left);
        Node right = largestBSTSubtreeHelper(root.right);

        if (root.val > left.maxNode && root.val < right.minNode) { // valid BST
            return new Node(Math.min(left.minNode, root.val), Math.max(right.maxNode, root.val), 1 + left.maxSize + right.maxSize);
        } else {
            // Otherwise, return [-inf, inf] so that parent can't be valid BST
            return new Node(Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE, 
                            Math.max(left.maxSize, right.maxSize));
        }
    }
}

class Node {
    public int minNode, maxNode, maxSize;

    Node(int minNode, int maxNode, int maxSize) {
        this.minNode = minNode;
        this.maxNode = maxNode;
        this.maxSize = maxSize;
    }
}
```

### **Complexity Analysis**

Here, $$N$$ and $$H$$ are the number of nodes and the max height of the given tree respectively.

* Time complexity: $$O(N)$$.
  * In `largestBSTSubtree` function, we traverse all nodes of the given tree, and for each node, we find if the subtree rooted at the current node is a BST which takes $$O(1)$$ time and if it is a BST, we calculate the number of nodes in this subtree which also takes $$O(1)$$ time. Thus, for $$N$$ nodes this algorithm takes $$O(N)$$ time.
* Space complexity: $$O(N)$$.
  * Recursive stack can take at most $$O(H)$$ space; in the worst-case scenario, the height of the tree will equal $$N$$.
