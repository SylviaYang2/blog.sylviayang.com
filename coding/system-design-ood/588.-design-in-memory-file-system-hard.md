# 588. Design In-Memory File System (Hard)

Design a data structure that simulates an in-memory file system.

Implement the FileSystem class:

* `FileSystem()` Initializes the object of the system.
*   `List<String> ls(String path)`

    * If `path` is a file path, returns a list that only contains this file's name.
    * If `path` is a directory path, returns the list of file and directory names **in this directory**.

    The answer should in **lexicographic order**.
* `void mkdir(String path)` Makes a new directory according to the given `path`. The given directory path does not exist. If the middle directories in the path do not exist, you should create them as well.
* `void addContentToFile(String filePath, String content)`
  * If `filePath` does not exist, creates that file containing given `content`.
  * If `filePath` already exists, appends the given `content` to original content.
* `String readContentFromFile(String filePath)` Returns the content in the file at `filePath`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/filesystem.png)

<pre><code><strong>Input
</strong>["FileSystem", "ls", "mkdir", "addContentToFile", "ls", "readContentFromFile"]
[[], ["/"], ["/a/b/c"], ["/a/b/c/d", "hello"], ["/"], ["/a/b/c/d"]]
<strong>Output
</strong>[null, [], null, null, ["a"], "hello"]

<strong>Explanation
</strong>FileSystem fileSystem = new FileSystem();
fileSystem.ls("/");                         // return []
fileSystem.mkdir("/a/b/c");
fileSystem.addContentToFile("/a/b/c/d", "hello");
fileSystem.ls("/");                         // return ["a"]
fileSystem.readContentFromFile("/a/b/c/d"); // return "hello"
</code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= path.length, filePath.length <= 100`
* `path` and `filePath` are absolute paths which begin with `'/'` and do not end with `'/'` except that the path is just `"/"`.
* You can assume that all directory names and file names only contain lowercase letters, and the same names will not exist in the same directory.
* You can assume that all operations will be passed valid parameters, and users will not attempt to retrieve file content or list a directory or file that does not exist.
* `1 <= content.length <= 50`
* At most `300` calls will be made to `ls`, `mkdir`, `addContentToFile`, and `readContentFromFile`.







Now, we'll discuss how we implement the various commands required.

1. `ls`: In this case, we start off by initializing $$ttt$$, a temporary directory pointer, to the root directory. We split the input directory path based on `/` and obtain the individual levels of directory names in a $$ddd$$ array. Then, we traverse over the tree directory structure based on the individual directories found and we keep on updating the $$ttt$$ directory pointer to point to the new level of directory(child) as we go on entering deeper into the directory structure. At the end, we will stop at either the end level directory or at the file name depending upon the input given. If the last level in the input happens to be a file name, we simply need to return the file name. So, we directly return the last entry in the $$ddd$$ array. If the last level entry happens to be a directory, we can obtain its subdirectory list from the list of keys in its $$dirsdirsdirs$$ hashmap. Similarly, we can obtain the list of files in the last directory from the keys in the corresponding $$filesfilesfiles$$ hashmap. We append the two lists obtained, sort them and return the sorted appended list.
2. `mkdir`: In response to this command, as in case of `ls`, we start entering the directory structure level by level. Whenever we reach a state where a directory mentioned in the path of `mkdir` doesn't exist, we create a new entry in the last valid directory's $$dirsdirsdirs$$ structure and initialize its subdirectory list as an empty list. We keep on doing so till we reach the end level directory.
3. `addContentToFile`: In response to this command as well, as in case of `ls`, we start entering the directory structure level by level. When we reach the level of the file name, we check if the file name already exists in the $$filesfilesfiles$$ keys. If it exists, we concatenate the current contents to the contents of the file(in the value section of the corresponding file). If it doesn't exist, we create a new entry in the current directory's $$filesfilesfiles$$ and initialize its contents with the current contents.
4. `readContentFromFile`: As the previous cases, we reach the last directory level by traversing through the directory structure level by level. Then, in the last directory, we search for the file name entry in the corresponding $$filesfilesfiles$$' keys and return its corresponding value as the contents of the file.



```java
public class FileSystem {
    class Dir {
        HashMap < String, Dir > dirs = new HashMap < > ();
        HashMap < String, String > files = new HashMap < > ();
    }
    Dir root;
    public FileSystem() {
        root = new Dir();
    }
    public List < String > ls(String path) {
        Dir t = root;
        List < String > files = new ArrayList < > ();
        if (!path.equals("/")) {
            String[] d = path.split("/");
            for (int i = 1; i < d.length - 1; i++) {
                t = t.dirs.get(d[i]);
            }
            if (t.files.containsKey(d[d.length - 1])) {
                files.add(d[d.length - 1]);
                return files;
            } else {
                t = t.dirs.get(d[d.length - 1]);
            }
        }
        files.addAll(new ArrayList < > (t.dirs.keySet()));
        files.addAll(new ArrayList < > (t.files.keySet()));
        Collections.sort(files);
        return files;
    }

    public void mkdir(String path) {
        Dir t = root;
        String[] d = path.split("/");
        for (int i = 1; i < d.length; i++) {
            if (!t.dirs.containsKey(d[i]))
                t.dirs.put(d[i], new Dir());
            t = t.dirs.get(d[i]);
        }
    }

    public void addContentToFile(String filePath, String content) {
        Dir t = root;
        String[] d = filePath.split("/");
        for (int i = 1; i < d.length - 1; i++) {
            t = t.dirs.get(d[i]);
        }
        t.files.put(d[d.length - 1], t.files.getOrDefault(d[d.length - 1], "") + content);
    }

    public String readContentFromFile(String filePath) {
        Dir t = root;
        String[] d = filePath.split("/");
        for (int i = 1; i < d.length - 1; i++) {
            t = t.dirs.get(d[i]);
        }
        return t.files.get(d[d.length - 1]);
    }
}

**Performance Analysis**

* The time complexity of executing an `ls` command is $$O(m+n+klog(k))O\big(m+n+klog(k)\big)O(m+n+klog(k))$$. Here, $$mmm$$ refers to the length of the input string. We need to scan the input string once to split it and determine the various levels. $$nnn$$ refers to the depth of the last directory level in the given input for `ls`. This factor is taken because we need to enter $$nnn$$ levels of the tree structure to reach the last level. $$kkk$$ refers to the number of entries(files+subdirectories) in the last level directory(in the current input). We need to sort these names giving a factor of $$klog(k)klog(k)klog(k)$$.
* The time complexity of executing an `mkdir` command is $$O(m+n)O(m+n)O(m+n)$$. Here, $$mmm$$ refers to the length of the input string. We need to scan the input string once to split it and determine the various levels. $$nnn$$ refers to the depth of the last directory level in the `mkdir` input. This factor is taken because we need to enter $$nnn$$ levels of the tree structure to reach the last level.
* The time complexity of both `addContentToFile` and `readContentFromFile` is $$O(m+n)O(m+n)O(m+n)$$. Here, $$mmm$$ refers to the length of the input string. We need to scan the input string once to split it and determine the various levels. $$nnn$$ refers to the depth of the file name in the current input. This factor is taken because we need to enter $$nnn$$ levels of the tree structure to reach the level where the files's contents need to be added/read from.
* The advantage of this scheme of maintaining the directory structure is that it is expandable to include even more commands easily. For example, `rmdir` to remove a directory given an input directory path. We need to simply reach to the destined directory level and remove the corresponding directory entry from the corresponding $$dirsdirsdirs$$ keys.
* Renaming files/directories is also very simple, since all we need to do is to create a temporary copy of the directory structure/file with a new name and delete the last entry.
* Relocating a hierarchichal subdirectory structure from one directory to the other is also very easy, since, all we need to do is obtain the address for the corresponding subdirectory class, and assign the same at the new positon in the new directory structure.
* Extracting only directories or files list on any path is easy in this case, since we maintain separate entires for $$dirsdirsdirs$$ and $$filesfilesfiles$$.
