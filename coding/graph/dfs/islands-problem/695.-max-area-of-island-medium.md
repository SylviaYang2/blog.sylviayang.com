# 695. Max Area of Island (Medium)

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
</strong><strong>Output: 6
</strong><strong>Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
</strong><strong>Output: 0
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 50`
* `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        int res = 0;
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    res = Math.max(res, dfs(grid, i, j));
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    private int dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n) {
            return 0;
        }
        // if grid[i][j] already the water, skip
        if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // flood the cell
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        int num = 1;
        num += dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
        num += dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        num += dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
        num += dfs(grid, i, j - 1);

        return num;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$O(M×N)$$ where $$M$$ is the number of rows and\
  $$N$$ is the number of columns.
* Space complexity : worst case $$O(M×N)$$ in case that the grid map\
  is filled with lands where DFS goes by $$M×N$$ deep.
