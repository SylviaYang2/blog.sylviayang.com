# 200. Number of Islands (Medium)

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: grid = [
</strong>  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
<strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: grid = [
</strong>  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
<strong>Output: 3
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 300`
* `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.



### Approach: DFS

We flood the **visited** cell with '**0**' so that we don't need to keep an extra `visited` array, because we skip the '0' cell anyways.

````java
```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int res = 0;
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    res++;
                    dfs(grid, i, j); // flood the island
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n) {
            return;
        }
        // if grid[i][j] already the water, skip
        if (grid[i][j] == '0') {
            return;
        }

        // flood the cell
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$O(M×N)$$ where $$M$$ is the number of rows and\
  $$N$$ is the number of columns.
* Space complexity : worst case $$O(M×N)$$ in case that the grid map\
  is filled with lands where DFS goes by $$M×N$$ deep.
