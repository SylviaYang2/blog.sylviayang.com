# 130. Surrounded Regions (Medium)

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**"Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically."**

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
</strong><strong>Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
</strong><strong>Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
</strong>- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: board = [["X"]]
</strong><strong>Output: [["X"]]
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `m == board.length`
* `n == board[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 200`
* `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.



### Approach: DFS

"**Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X**'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically."

**Algorithm**

Let us start with the DFS algorithm, which usually results in a more concise code than the BFS algorithm. The algorithm consists of three steps:

* Step 1). We select all the cells that are located on the borders of the board.
* Step 2). Start from each of the above selected cell, we then perform the _DFS_ traversal.
  * If a cell on the border happens to be `O`, then we know that this cell is _alive_, together with the other `O` cells that are _connected_ to this border cell, based on the description of the problem. Two cells are _connected_, if there exists a path consisting of only `O` letter that bridges between the two cells.
  * Based on the above conclusion, the goal of our DFS traversal would be to _mark_ out all those _**connected**_ `O` cells that is originated from the border, with any distinguished letter such as `E`.
* Step 3). Once we iterate through all border cells, we would then obtain three types of cells:
  * The one with the `X` letter: the cell that we could consider as the wall.
  * The one with the `O` letter: the cells that are spared in our _DFS_ traversal, _i.e._ these cells has no connection to the border, therefore they are _**captured**_. We then should replace these cell with `X` letter.
  * The one with the `E` letter: these are the cells that are marked during our DFS traversal, _i.e._ these are the cells that has at least one connection to the borders, therefore they are not _captured_. As a result, we would revert the cell to its original letter `O`.

```java
public class Solution {
  protected Integer ROWS = 0;
  protected Integer COLS = 0;

  public void solve(char[][] board) {
    if (board == null || board.length == 0) {
      return;
    }
    this.ROWS = board.length;
    this.COLS = board[0].length;

    List<Pair<Integer, Integer>> borders = new LinkedList<Pair<Integer, Integer>>();
    // Step 1). construct the list of border cells
    for (int r = 0; r < this.ROWS; ++r) {
      borders.add(new Pair(r, 0));
      borders.add(new Pair(r, this.COLS - 1));
    }
    for (int c = 0; c < this.COLS; ++c) {
      borders.add(new Pair(0, c));
      borders.add(new Pair(this.ROWS - 1, c));
    }

    // Step 2). mark the escaped cells
    for (Pair<Integer, Integer> pair : borders) {
      this.DFS(board, pair.first, pair.second);
    }

    // Step 3). flip the cells to their correct final states
    for (int r = 0; r < this.ROWS; ++r) {
      for (int c = 0; c < this.COLS; ++c) {
        if (board[r][c] == 'O')
          board[r][c] = 'X';
        if (board[r][c] == 'E')
          board[r][c] = 'O';
      }
    }
  }

  protected void DFS(char[][] board, int row, int col) {
    if (board[row][col] != 'O')
      return;

    board[row][col] = 'E';
    if (col < this.COLS - 1)
      this.DFS(board, row, col + 1);
    if (row < this.ROWS - 1)
      this.DFS(board, row + 1, col);
    if (col > 0)
      this.DFS(board, row, col - 1);
    if (row > 0)
      this.DFS(board, row - 1, col);
  }
}


class Pair<U, V> {
  public U first;
  public V second;

  public Pair(U first, V second) {
    this.first = first;
    this.second = second;
  }
}
