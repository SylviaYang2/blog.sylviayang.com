During the exploration process, as soon as we reach the _**target**_ point, we then can call the current path the _shortest_ path, since our exploration follows the order of distance.

> One can imagine the whole process as if we send a sound wave to determine the distance to an unknown object.\
> The sound wave propagates in all directions with the same speed, while its scope grows as a _**circle**_.\
> Once the circle reaches the target object, the _**radius**_ is the shortest distance between the origin and the target object.

### Approach: BFS

It said that abs(x) + abs(y) = 300, that means we can say that minimum value of x and y can be -300 and maximum value of x and y can be +300, but we have offsets of (2,1), (1,2), (-1, -2), (-2, -1).....etc

so, -300 + (-2) = -302\
and +300 + (2) = 302

So, we get -302 as new minimum and +302 as new maximum.

Thus, (-302, 302) is range and so array length should be 302\*2 + 1 = 605, which means\
now 0 corresponds to -302, and 604 corresponds to +302, and 605 ( in case to avoid index out of bounds)

Thus, to map any index, we add 302 to nextIndex , which is next\[0] + 302 and next\[1] + 302.

class Solution {
    public int minKnightMoves(int x, int y) {
        // the offsets in the eight directions
        int[][] offsets = {{1, 2}, {2, 1}, {2, -1}, {1, -2},
                {-1, -2}, {-2, -1}, {-2, 1}, {-1, 2}};

        // - Rather than using the inefficient HashSet, we use the bitmap
        //     otherwise we would run out of time for the test cases.
        // - We create a bitmap that is sufficient to cover all the possible
        //     inputs, according to the description of the problem.
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[607][607];

        Deque<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.addLast(new int[]{0, 0});
        int steps = 0;

        while (queue.size() > 0) {
            int currLevelSize = queue.size();
            // iterate through the current level
            for (int i = 0; i < currLevelSize; i++) {
                int[] curr = queue.removeFirst();
                if (curr[0] == x && curr[1] == y) {
                    return steps;
                }

                for (int[] offset : offsets) {
                    int[] next = new int[]{curr[0] + offset[0], curr[1] + offset[1]};
                    // align the coordinate to the bitmap
                    if (!visited[next[0] + 302][next[1] + 302]) {
                        visited[next[0] + 302][next[1] + 302] = true;
                        queue.addLast(next);
                    }
                }
            }
            steps++;
        }
        // move on to the next level
