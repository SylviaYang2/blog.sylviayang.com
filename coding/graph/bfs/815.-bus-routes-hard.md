# 815. Bus Routes (Hard)

You are given an array `routes` representing bus routes where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the `ith` bus repeats forever.

* For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the `0th` bus travels in the sequence `1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> ...` forever.

You will start at the bus stop `source` (You are not on any bus initially), and you want to go to the bus stop `target`. You can travel between bus stops by buses only.

Return _the least number of buses you must take to travel from_ `source` _to_ `target`. Return `-1` if it is not possible.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: routes = [[1,2,7],[3,6,7]], source = 1, target = 6
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong><strong>Explanation: The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: routes = [[7,12],[4,5,15],[6],[15,19],[9,12,13]], source = 15, target = 12
</strong><strong>Output: -1
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= routes.length <= 500`.
* `1 <= routes[i].length <= 105`
* All the values of `routes[i]` are **unique**.
* `sum(routes[i].length) <= 105`
* `0 <= routes[i][j] < 106`
* `0 <= source, target < 106`



### Approach: BFS



In the problem statement, it's given that we are not on any bus initially. Hence, to start from the bus stop `source` we can board any of the bus that has the `source` as one of the stops in its route. So the breadth-first search here needs to be a multi-source BFS starting with all the buses that have the `source` in stops. During the BFS, we will pop the first bus from the queue and iterate over the stops that this route involves. For each stop, we will check if this stop is equal to `target`, and then we can return the current count of buses `busCount`. If the stop is not equal to `target` then we will iterate over all the routes that have this stop and add them to the queue if the route is not visited before. Note that we are keeping track of visited routes instead of bus stops because when we visit a route we are essentially visiting all the stops in that route and hence keeping track of visited stops individually is not that efficient.

If we have completed the BFS and still haven't reached the `target`, it implies there is no way to reach that stop and hence we can return `-1`.

**Algorithm**

1. Return `0` if the `source` and `target` are the same.
2. Initialize an empty map from an integer to a list of integers `adjList` to store the edges. The key is the bus stop and the value is the list of integers denoting the indices of routes that have this stop.
3. Initialize an empty queue `q` and an unordered set `vis` to keep track of visited routes.
4. Insert the initial routes into the queue `q` and mark them visited in `vis`.
5. Iterate over the queue while it's not empty and do the following:
   1. Pop the route from the queue.
   2. Iterate over the stops in the route.
   3. If the stop is equal to `target`, return `busCount`.
   4. Otherwise, iterate over the routes for this stop in the map `adjList`.
   5. Add the unvisited routes to the queue and mark them visited.
6. Return `-1` after completing the BFS.

        HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>> adjList = new HashMap<>();

            for (int stop : routes[r]) {
                // Add all the routes that have this stop.
                ArrayList<Integer> route = adjList.getOrDefault(stop, new ArrayList<>());
                route.add(r);
                adjList.put(stop, route);
            }
        }

        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<Integer> vis = new HashSet<Integer>(routes.length);
        // Insert all the routes in the queue that have the source stop.

            q.add(route);

        }

        int busCount = 1;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {

                        return busCount;
                    }

                    // Iterate over the next possible routes from the current stop.
                    for (int nextRoute : adjList.get(stop)) {
                        if (!vis.contains(nextRoute)) {
                            vis.add(nextRoute);
