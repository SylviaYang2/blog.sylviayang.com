# 716. Max Stack (Hard)

Design a max stack data structure that supports the stack operations and supports finding the stack's maximum element.

Implement the `MaxStack` class:

* `MaxStack()` Initializes the stack object.
* `void push(int x)` Pushes element `x` onto the stack.
* `int pop()` Removes the element on top of the stack and returns it.
* `int top()` Gets the element on the top of the stack without removing it.
* `int peekMax()` Retrieves the maximum element in the stack without removing it.
* `int popMax()` Retrieves the maximum element in the stack and removes it. If there is more than one maximum element, only remove the **top-most** one.

You must come up with a solution that supports `O(1)` for each `top` call and `O(logn)` for each other call.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input
</strong>["MaxStack", "push", "push", "push", "top", "popMax", "top", "peekMax", "pop", "top"]
[[], [5], [1], [5], [], [], [], [], [], []]
<strong>Output
</strong>[null, null, null, null, 5, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]

<strong>Explanation
</strong>MaxStack stk = new MaxStack();
<strong>stk.push(5);   // [5] the top of the stack and the maximum number is 5.
</strong><strong>stk.push(1);   // [5, 1] the top of the stack is 1, but the maximum is 5.
</strong><strong>stk.push(5);   // [5, 1, 5] the top of the stack is 5, which is also the maximum, because it is the top most one.
</strong><strong>stk.top();     // return 5, [5, 1, 5] the stack did not change.
</strong><strong>stk.popMax();  // return 5, [5, 1] the stack is changed now, and the top is different from the max.
</strong><strong>stk.top();     // return 1, [5, 1] the stack did not change.
</strong><strong>stk.peekMax(); // return 5, [5, 1] the stack did not change.
</strong><strong>stk.pop();     // return 1, [5] the top of the stack and the max element is now 5.
</strong><strong>stk.top();     // return 5, [5] the stack did not change.
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `-107 <= x <= 107`
* At most `105` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, `peekMax`, and `popMax`.
* There will be **at least one element** in the stack when `pop`, `top`, `peekMax`, or `popMax` is called.



### Approach: Two TreeSets

What's different than 155. Min Stack is that:&#x20;

* We can find the last or the max element **quickly** for a single operation of `top` or `peekMax`.&#x20;
* The primary challenge is to figure out an efficient way to <mark style="color:red;">**`remove`**</mark> a specified element in both records of the push **`order`** track and the **`value`** track.

**Algorithm**

As we discussed in Intuition, we need to maintain two balanced trees respectively:&#x20;

* the former is in pushing order (`stack`)
* the latter is sorted by values (`values`).&#x20;

Besides, we also need to tag each element with a unique `id`.&#x20;

1. For `push` operation, we need to push the element with the current `cnt` into both two balanced trees, `stack` and `values`, which insert the element by `id` and `val` respectively. And then, don't forget to increase `cnt`.
2. For `top` and `peekMax:` return the last element value of `stack` for `top` query, and the last element value of `values` for `peekMax`.
3. For `pop` and `popMax:` For `pop`, we first remove the last element in `stack`, and then remove the element in `values`; for `popMax`, we first remove the last element in `values`, and then remove the element in `stack`.

```java
class MaxStack {
    TreeSet<int[]> stack;
    TreeSet<int[]> values;
    int id;

    public MaxStack() {
        Comparator<int[]> comp = (a, b) -> {
            return a[0] == b[0] ? a[1] - b[1] : a[0] - b[0];
        };
        stack = new TreeSet<>(comp);
        values = new TreeSet<>(comp);
        id = 0;
    }
    
    public void push(int x) {
        stack.add(new int[] {id, x});
        values.add(new int[] {x, id});
        id++;
    }
    
    public int pop() {
        int[] res = stack.pollLast();
        values.remove(new int[] {res[1], res[0]});
        return res[1];
    }
    
    public int top() {
        return stack.last()[1];
    }
    
    public int peekMax() {
        return values.last()[0];
    }
    
    public int popMax() {
        int[] res = values.pollLast();
        stack.remove(new int[] {res[1], res[0]});
        return res[0];
    }
}

/**
 * Your MaxStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MaxStack obj = new MaxStack();
 * obj.push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj.pop();
 * int param_3 = obj.top();
 * int param_4 = obj.peekMax();
 * int param_5 = obj.popMax();
 */
```

### Complexity

Let $$N$$ be the number of elements to add to the stack.

* Time Complexity: $$O(log⁡N)$$ for each operation except for initialization. All operations other than initialization are involved with finding/inserting/removing elements in a balanced tree once or twice. In general, the upper bound of time complexity for each of them is $$O(log⁡N)$$. However, note that `top` and `peekMax` operations, requiring only the last element in a balanced tree, `last` for `TreeSet` in Java haven't implemented similar optimization yet, we have to get the last element in $$O(log⁡N)$$.
* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$, the maximum size of the two balanced trees.
