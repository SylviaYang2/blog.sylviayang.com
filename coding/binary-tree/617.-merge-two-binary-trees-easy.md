# 617. Merge Two Binary Trees (Easy)

You are given two binary trees `root1` and `root2`.

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

Return _the merged tree_.

**Note:** The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/05/merge.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root1 = [1,3,2,5], root2 = [2,1,3,null,4,null,7]
</strong><strong>Output: [3,4,5,5,4,null,7]
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1,2]
</strong><strong>Output: [2,2]
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
* `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`

````java
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        if (root1 == null || root2 == null) {
            return root1 == null ? root2 : root1;
        }
        TreeNode merged = new TreeNode(root1.val + root2.val);
        merged.left = mergeTrees(root1.left, root2.left);
        merged.right = mergeTrees(root1.right, root2.right);

        return merged;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity : $$O(m)$$. A total of $$m$$ nodes need to be traversed. Here, $$m$$ represents the minimum number of nodes from the two given trees.
* Space complexity : $$O(m)O(m)$$. The depth of the recursion tree can go upto $$m$$ in the case of a skewed tree. In average case, depth will be $$O(logm)$$.
