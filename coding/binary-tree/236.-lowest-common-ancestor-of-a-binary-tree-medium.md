# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree (Medium)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest\_common\_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
</strong><strong>Output: 5
</strong><strong>Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
* `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `p != q`
* `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

### Approach: DFS

**Intuition**

The moment you encounter either of the nodes `p` or `q`, return some boolean flag. The flag helps to determine if we found the required nodes in any of the paths.&#x20;

* The least common ancestor would then be：&#x20;
* the node for which **both** the subtree recursions return a `True` flag.&#x20;
* It can also be the node which **itself** is one of `p` or `q` and for which **one of the subtree** recursions returns a `True` flag.

**Algorithm**

1. Start traversing the tree from the root node.
2. If the current node itself is one of `p` or `q`, we would mark a variable `mid` as `True` and continue the search for the other node in the left and right branches.
3. If either of the left or the right branch returns `True`, this means one of the two nodes was found below.
4. If at any point in the traversal, any 2 of the 3 flags `left`, `right` or `mid` become `True`, this means we have found the lowest common ancestor for the nodes `p` and `q`.

```java
private TreeNode ans;

public Solution() {
    // Variable to store LCA node.
    this.ans = null;
}

private boolean recurseTree(TreeNode currentNode, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {

    // If reached the end of a branch, return false.
    if (currentNode == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Left Recursion. If left recursion returns true, set left = 1 else 0
    int left = this.recurseTree(currentNode.left, p, q) ? 1 : 0;

    // Right Recursion
    int right = this.recurseTree(currentNode.right, p, q) ? 1 : 0;

    // If the current node is one of p or q
    int mid = (currentNode == p || currentNode == q) ? 1 : 0;


    // If any two of the flags left, right or mid become True
    if (mid + left + right >= 2) {
        this.ans = currentNode;
    }

    // Return true if any one of the three bool values is True.
    return (mid + left + right > 0);
}

public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
    // Traverse the tree
    this.recurseTree(root, p, q);
    return this.ans;
}
```
