# 1048. Longest String Chain (Medium)

You are given an array of `words` where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

`wordA` is a **predecessor** of `wordB` if and only if we can insert **exactly one** letter anywhere in `wordA` **without changing the order of the other characters** to make it equal to `wordB`.

* For example, `"abc"` is a **predecessor** of `"abac"`, while `"cba"` is not a **predecessor** of `"bcad"`.

A **word chain** is a sequence of words `[word1, word2, ..., wordk]` with `k >= 1`, where `word1` is a **predecessor** of `word2`, `word2` is a **predecessor** of `word3`, and so on. A single word is trivially a **word chain** with `k == 1`.

Return _the **length** of the **longest possible word chain** with words chosen from the given list of_ `words`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
</strong><strong>Output: 5
</strong><strong>Explanation: All the words can be put in a word chain ["xb", "xbc", "cxbc", "pcxbc", "pcxbcf"].
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: words = ["abcd","dbqca"]
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong><strong>Explanation: The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.
</strong>["abcd","dbqca"] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.
</code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 16`
* `words[i]` only consists of lowercase English letters.



### Approach: DP

We know that the order of the words in the list doesn't matter. So we can **sort** the words in ascending order based on their length. Next, we can iterate over the sorted list and calculate the length of the longest sequence possible where the word at index $$i$$ is the end word. We store this result in a map where **`key`** is the **word** and **`value`** is the sequence **length**. By doing this we ensure that, for each word that we encounter, we already know the result of all of its possible predecessors.&#x20;

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize a map where `key` is the word and `value` is the length of the longest word sequence possible with the `key` as the end word.
2. Sort the word list in increasing order of the word length.
3. Initialize `longestWordSequenceLength` to 1. This variable holds the length of the longest word sequence possible.
4. Iterate over the sorted list.
5. For each word initialize `presentLength` to 1.
6. Iterate over the entire length of each word.
   * Delete the character at $$ithi^{th}ith$$ position from the current word and assign the new word to the variable `predecessor`.
   * Check if `predecessor` is present in the list or not.
   * If the `predecessor` is present, then assign its mapped value to `previousLength`. Update the `presentLength` if `previousLength + 1` is greater than the `presentLength`.
7. After terminating the inner `for` loop, assign `presentLength` to the current word in the map `dp`.
8. Update the `longestWordSequenceLength` if the longest word sequence formed with the current word as the end word is longer than the previously considered word sequence.
9. After terminating the outer `for` loop, return `longestWordSequenceLength`.
