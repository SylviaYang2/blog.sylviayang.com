# 75. Sort Colors (Medium)

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place\_algorithm) so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
</strong><strong>Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [2,0,1]
</strong><strong>Output: [0,1,2]
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 300`
* `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

&#x20;

**Follow up:** Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only **constant** extra space?



### Approach: Three Pointers

### Note:

1. `p0` is the right boundary of 0, and `p2` is the left boundary of 2 (`p0` and `p2` are the next place to put 0 and 2);
2. Why increment both left and curr when `nums[curr] == 0, and only decrement right when nums[curr] == 2?`
   1. Because `nums[curr]`can only be 0 or 1
   2. We can only guarantee that the numbers in `[p2, nums.length - 1]` is 2, can't guarantee the interval in between. `Nums[curr]` swapped can either be 0, 1, or 2.

````java
```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0, curr = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (curr <= right) {
            if (nums[curr] == 0) {
                swap(nums, left, curr);
                left++;
                curr++;
            } else if (nums[curr] == 2) {
                swap(nums, curr, right);
                right--;
            } else if (nums[curr] == 1) {
                curr++;
            }
        }
    }

    private void swap(int[] nums, int l, int r) {
        int temp = nums[l];
        nums[l] = nums[r];
        nums[r] = temp;
    }
}
