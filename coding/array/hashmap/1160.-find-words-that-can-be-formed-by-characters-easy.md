# 1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters (Easy)

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`.

A string is **good** if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return _the sum of lengths of all good strings in words_.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
</strong><strong>Output: 6
</strong><strong>Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
</strong><strong>Output: 10
</strong><strong>Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100`
* `words[i]` and `chars` consist of lowercase English letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countCharacters(String[] words, String chars) {
        int count = 0;
        Map<Character, Integer> charsMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c: chars.toCharArray()) {
          charsMap.put(c, charsMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        for (String word: words) {
          int[] wordCount = new int[26];
          boolean valid = true;

          for (char c: word.toCharArray()) {
            wordCount[c - 'a']++;
          }

          for (char c: word.toCharArray()) {
            if (!charsMap.containsKey(c) || charsMap.get(c) < wordCount[c - 'a']) {
              valid = false;
              break;
            }
          }

          if (valid) {
            count += word.length();
          }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Complexity:

* Given $$n$$ as the length of `chars`, $$m$$ as the length of `words`, and $$k$$ as the average length of each word in `words`,
  *   Time complexity: $$O(n+m⋅k)$$

      To calculate `counts`, we iterate over each character of `chars` once, costing $$O(n)$$.

      Next, we iterate over $$O(m)$$ elements in `words`. For each element, we calculate `wordCount` by iterating over the element, which costs $$O(k)$$. We then perform a loop over `26` indices, costing $$O(1)$$. Overall, the for loop costs $$O(m⋅k)$$.\
