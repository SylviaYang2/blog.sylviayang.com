# 740. Delete and Earn

### Approach: DP

At any operation, we pick a number, let's say `x`, and delete **all** occurrences of `x - 1` and `x + 1`. That means if `x` occurs multiple times in `nums` and we take one, we may as well take all of them because after deleting all `x - 1` and `x + 1`, we can only stand to gain more points by taking additional `x`. Then the total gain of taking `x` is `the`` `**`occurrences`**` ``of x` \* `x.` For example.`[2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]` would be converted to `{2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 1}`

When it comes to `x`, we have to make a choice: **take, or don't take.**

* If we take `x`, then we gain points equal to `x` times the number of times `x` occurs in `nums` -> we can pre-compute these values. For now, let's call this value `gain`.&#x20;
* However, because of the deletion, by taking `x`, we are no longer allowed to take `x - 1`. The largest number that we can still consider is **`x - 2`**.&#x20;
* Therefore, if we choose to take `x`, then the most points that we can have here is `gain + maxPoints(x - 2)`, where `gain` is how many points we gain from taking `x` and `maxPoints(x - 2)` is the maximum number of points we can obtain from the numbers between `x - 2` and `0`.
* If we choose not to take `x`, then we don't gain any points here, but we still may have accumulated some points from numbers smaller than `x`. Because we didn't take `x`, we did not close the door to `x - 1`. In this case, the most points we can have here is `maxPoints(x - 1)`.

This forms our <mark style="color:red;">**recurrence**</mark> relation:&#x20;

for an arbitrary `x`, **`maxPoints(x) = max(maxPoints(x - 1), maxPoints(x - 2) + gain)`**, where `gain` is the number of points we can gain from taking `x`.

````java
```java
class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        // dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + i * count[i])
        int maxNum = 0;
        for (int num: nums) {
            maxNum = Math.max(maxNum, num);
        }
        int[] dp = new int[maxNum + 1];
        int[] count = new int[maxNum + 1];
        for (int num: nums) {
            count[num]++;
        }
        dp[1] = 1 * count[1];

        for (int i = 2; i <= maxNum; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + i * count[i]);
        }

        return dp[maxNum];
    }
}
```

### **Complexity Analysis**

Given $$N$$ as the length of `nums` and $$k$$ as the maximum element in `nums`,

*   Time complexity: $$O(N+k)$$

    To populate `points`, we need to iterate through `nums` once, which costs $$O(N)$$ time. Then, we populate `maxPoints` by iterating over it. The length of `maxPoints` is equal to `k + 1`, so this will cost $$O(k)$$ time. Our final time complexity is $$O(N+k)$$.
*   Space complexity: $$O(N+k)$$

    The extra space we use is the hash table `points` and our DP array `maxPoints`. The size of `maxPoints` is equal to `k + 1`, which means it takes $$O(k)$$ space. The size of `points` is equal to the number of unique elements in `nums`. In the worst case, where every element in `nums` is unique, this will take $$O(N)$$ space. Our final space complexity is $$O(N+k)$$.
