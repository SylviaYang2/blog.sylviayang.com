# 70. Climbing Stairs (Easy)

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
</strong>1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
</strong>1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
</code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 45`&#x20;



### Approach: DP

One can reach $$ith$$ step in one of the two ways:

1. Taking a single step from $$(i−1)th$$ step.
2. Taking a step of $$2$$ from $$(i−2)th$$ step.

So, the total number of ways to reach $$ithi^{th}ith$$ is equal to sum of ways of reaching $$(i−1)th$$ step and ways of reaching $$(i−2)th$$ step.

Let $$dp[i]$$ denotes the number of ways to reach on $$ith$$ step:

$$dp[i]=dp[i−1]+dp[i−2]$$

```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
