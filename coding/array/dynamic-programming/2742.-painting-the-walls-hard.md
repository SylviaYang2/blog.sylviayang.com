# 2742. Painting the Walls (Hard)

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays, `cost` and `time`, of size `n` representing the costs and the time taken to paint `n` different walls respectively. There are two painters available:

* A **paid painter** that paints the `ith` wall in `time[i]` units of time and takes `cost[i]` units of money.
* A **free painter** that paints **any** wall in `1` unit of time at a cost of `0`. But the free painter can only be used if the paid painter is already **occupied**.

Return _the minimum amount of money required to paint the_ `n` _walls._

**Example 1:**

<pre data-overflow="wrap"><code><strong>Input: cost = [1,2,3,2], time = [1,2,3,2]
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 1 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 3 units of time; meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 2 and 3, free of cost in 2 units of time. Thus, the total cost is 1 + 2 = 3.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre data-overflow="wrap"><code><strong>Input: cost = [2,3,4,2], time = [1,1,1,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 3 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 2 units of time; meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 1 and 2, free of cost in 2 units of time. Thus, the total cost is 2 + 2 = 4.
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= cost.length <= 500`
* `cost.length == time.length`
* `1 <= cost[i] <= 106`
* `1 <= time[i] <= 500`



### Approach: DP

如果付费油漆匠刷 $$j$$ 面墙花了 $$k$$ 的时间，那么免费油漆匠就能把另外 $$k$$ 面墙刷掉，也就是说总共刷了 $$(j+k)$$ 面墙。

`dp(i, painted)` = the minimum cost to paint `painted` walls when considering index `i` and beyond. We have two base cases here.

1. If `painted <= n`, we have painted all the walls. We can `return 0`.
2. If `i == n`, we have run out of walls to put the paid painter on and the task is impossible. We return a large value like infinity.

Now, how do we calculate a given state `(i, painted)`? For the $$ith$$ wall, we have two options. We can either **hire** the paid painter for this wall or **not hire** them.

1. If we hire them, as mentioned above, we spend `cost[i]` and paint `1 + time[i]` walls. Then, we move to the next index. Thus, the cost of this option is `cost[i] + dp(i + 1, painted - 1 - time[i])`. (While the paid painter is occupied, the **free** painter can paint `time[i]` walls (since the free painter paints one wall per unit of time). Overall, we spent `cost[i]` money to paint `1 + time[i]` walls.)
2. If we don't hire them, we simply move to the next index. The cost of this option is `dp(i + 1, painted)`.

Let's call the first option `paint` and the second option `dontPaint`. Then, `dp(i, painted) = min(paint, dontPaint)`.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```java
class Solution {
    public int paintWalls(int[] cost, int[] time) {
        int n = cost.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][n + 1];

        // initialize to very large values since we need to compute min values
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[n][i] = (int) 1e9;
        }

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int painted = 1; painted <= n; painted++) {
                int hire = cost[i] + dp[i + 1][Math.max(0, painted - 1 - time[i])]; // prevent index out of bound
                int notHire = dp[i + 1][painted];
                dp[i][painted] = Math.min(hire, notHire);
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n];
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

**Complexity Analysis**

Given $$n$$ as the length of `cost` and `time`,

*   Time complexity: $$O(n^2)$$

    `i` ranges from `0` to `n` and `remain` ranges from `n` to `0`. Thus, there are $$O(n^2)$$ states. Each state is calculated only once due to memoization.
*   Space complexity: $$O(n^2)$$

    We use some space for the recursion call stack, but it is dominated by the space used to memoize our function, which is equal to the number of states. There are $$O(n^2)$$ states.
